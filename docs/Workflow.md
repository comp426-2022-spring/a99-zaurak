## Goals

### App Specific Goals
1. Develop an app to display most recent COVID-19 data
2. Preferebly display data in a bar-graph or other type of visual tool.
3. Create functionalitie that allows user to create an account on this COVID-19 dashboard.
4. Restrict dashboard access to registered users.
5. App will have menu bar where Global data, US data, and NC data can be selected to be displayed.
6. Menu bar has logout and account buttons.

### For COMP 426 Staff:
1. Back-end specifications
    1. API built on whatever framework you choose. You can build an API that interacts with other APIs as well in order to integrate them.
    2. API root endpoint at http://HOST/app/.
    3. Should create (if nonexistent) and interact with a database of users and interactions (this can be logs, even). These can be separate databases for different microservices or separate tables in one database. It is up to your teamâ€™s decisions.
    4. Database can be of any type you choose.
2. Front-end specifications
    1. Give users the ability to register an account, update their information, see their information somewhere, and delete their account.
    2. Interactions with the front end should be logged in a database.
3. Database specifications
    1. User database - registration details (username, email address, etc.)
    2. Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, access logs, etc.)
4. Documentation
    1. License documenation - Choose a license and include it in the repository just like we have been.
    2. README.md file with basic descriptiong, installation requirements/instructions, dependency list, run instructions
    3. /docs/ directory containing full documentation of every available API endpoint that you create for your app. This directory should also house an archive of your planning documentation.
    4. Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation)
    5. User instructions in the interface
5. Demo video

6. Self/group evaluation (Individual group members: this is part of the final exam for the course.)
